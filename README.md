## üöÄ Deployment

### Method 1: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers with one click

`Deploy Backend`<br>
[![Deploy to Cloudflare (Backend)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/98tools/voter98/backend)

`Deploy Frontend`<br>
[![Deploy to Cloudflare (Frontend)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/98tools/voter98/frontend)

- from Cloudflare dashboard, Workers, voter98-backend, Bindings, `Add Binding`, choose `D1 database` and press Add, Variable name is `DB`, D1 database is `voter-db` which you'll create here
- again `Add Binding`, choose `KV namespace` and press Add, Variable name is `VOTER_KV`, KV namespace is `voter-kv` which you'll create here
- navigate to `Settings`, Variables and Secrets, `Add`, Text, Variable name is `FRONTEND_URL`, Value is `https://voter98-frontend.your-username.workers.dev`

### Method 2: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers manually

#### Prerequisites
* Cloudflare account
* Node.js 18+ installed
* Git repository cloned

#### Step 1: Install and Setup Wrangler CLI

```bash
npm install -g wrangler
wrangler login
```

#### Step 2: Create Cloudflare Resources

```bash
# Create D1 database
wrangler d1 create voter-db

# Create KV namespace (optional, for caching)
wrangler kv:namespace create VOTER_KV
wrangler kv:namespace create VOTER_KV --preview
```

#### Step 3: Configure Backend

1. **Copy configuration template**:
```bash
cd backend
cp wrangler.jsonc.template wrangler.jsonc
```

2. **Update `wrangler.jsonc` with your values**:
```json
{
  // ...

  "vars": {
    "JWT_SECRET": "your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production",
    "FRONTEND_URL": "https://your-frontend-url.workers.dev"
  },
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "VOTER_KV",
      "id": "YOUR_KV_NAMESPACE_ID_HERE",
      "preview_id": "YOUR_KV_PREVIEW_NAMESPACE_ID_HERE"
    }
  ],
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "DB",
      "database_name": "voter-db",
      "database_id": "YOUR_D1_DATABASE_ID_HERE"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. **Deploy backend**:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

4. **Note your backend URL** (e.g., `https://voter15-backend.your-username.workers.dev`)

#### Step 4: Configure Frontend

1. **Create environment file**:
```bash
cd ../frontend
```

2. **Create `.env` file**:
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://voter15-backend.your-username.workers.dev/api
```

3. **Build and deploy frontend**:
```bash
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

4. **Note your frontend URL** (e.g., `https://voter15-frontend.your-username.workers.dev`)

#### Step 5: Update Backend Configuration

1. **Update backend `wrangler.jsonc`** with your frontend URL:
```json
{
  "vars": {
    "JWT_SECRET": "your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production",
    "FRONTEND_URL": "https://your-frontend-url.workers.dev"
  }
}
```

2. **Redeploy backend**:
```bash
cd ../backend
npm run deploy
```

#### Step 6: Setup Database and Seed Data

1. **Apply database migrations**:
```bash
npm run db:migrate:remote
```

2. **Seed the database** (only in development):
```bash
# Make a POST request to seed endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.workers.dev/api/dev/seed
```

**Default seed user**:
- **Admin**: `admin@example.com` / `password123`

#### Step 7: Configure SMTP (Optional)

1. **Access your application** at your frontend URL
2. **Login as admin** using the seed credentials
3. **Navigate to Admin Panel** ‚Üí SMTP Settings
4. **Configure your SMTP settings**:
   - SMTP Host (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - Port (e.g., `587` for TLS)
   - Username and Password
   - Daily email limits
   - Cron job limits

#### Step 8: Test Your Deployment

1. **Visit your frontend URL**
2. **Login with seed credentials**
3. **Create a test poll**
4. **Test email functionality** (if SMTP is configured)

### Environment Variables Reference

#### Backend Environment Variables (`wrangler.jsonc`)
```json
{
  "vars": {
    "JWT_SECRET": "your-jwt-secret-key",
    "FRONTEND_URL": "https://your-frontend-url.workers.dev"
  }
}
```

#### Frontend Environment Variables (`.env`)
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.workers.dev/api
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` in backend config matches your frontend URL exactly
2. **Database Connection**: Verify D1 database ID is correct in `wrangler.jsonc`
3. **Email Not Working**: Check SMTP configuration in Admin Panel
4. **Build Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

#### Development vs Production:

- **Development**: Use `npm run db:migrate:local` for local database
- **Production**: Use `npm run db:migrate:remote` for production database
- **Seeding**: Only available in development (JWT_SECRET contains "development")

### Deploy to Other Platforms

The built application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

* **Netlify**: Drag and drop the `dist` folder
* **Vercel**: Connect your repository for automatic deployments
* **GitHub Pages**: Use the built files from `dist/`
